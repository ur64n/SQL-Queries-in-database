/* 

RIGHT JOIN
LEFT JOIN

The LEFT JOIN keyword returns all records from the left table from the written function in the code.
The right join from the right. The function itself returns records that do not have a joined relationship.
It works on tables where there is no relationship.

*/

---------------------------------------------

Primary formula for left and right join

SELECT column name (s)
FROM right table name
LEFT JOIN left table name
ON right table name.column name = left table name.column name;

RIGHT JOIN works on the same pattern just replace the code with RIGHT JOIN

---------------------------------------------

Example LEFT JOIN - Will link records from a table where no relationship has been established. 
That is, we may have a customer who has never ordered any goods, but is registered in our database and has no OrderID assigned.
SQL will display him in our new statement, but without an assigned OrderID.
We will simply get the username but without an assigned order number.

SELECT orders.OrderID, customers.CustomerName
FROM customers
LEFT JOIN orders
ON orders.CustomerID = customers.CustomerID
ORDER BY orders.OrderID;
