---------------------------------------------

Example of subquery use

SELECT column1, column2.... 
FROM table
WHERE the selected column <,> or ≤
Now we add a subquery →
(SELECT column 
FROM table 
WHERE = 7);

In result we get all prices from product table where price from product table is bigger than this which value is product id 7, that is over than 30.

Practise example

SELECT *
FROM products
WHERE Price > 
(SELECT price FROM product WHERE ProductID = 7);
